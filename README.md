# KindPath / KindEarth Platform

KindPath is a systems framework and digital platform for working with
human, ecological, and institutional reality as it actually behaves
under stress, uncertainty, and time.

The platform is built on a simple axiom:

> **The real currency of life and society is intentional human time.**

Money, policy, markets, and services are downstream abstractions.
KindPath exists to make upstream conditions legible, measurable,
and governable without extraction.

## What this repository is

This repository contains the **core digital tooling, doctrine, and pilot
infrastructure** for the KindPath / KindEarth platform.

It is **not**:
- a consumer app
- a belief system
- a prediction engine
- a surveillance or optimisation system

It **is**:
- a set of interoperable tools for pilots, communities, practitioners,
  and researchers
- a sovereignty-first digital architecture
- a place to build, test, and falsify ideas carefully

---

## System Philosophy (non-negotiable)

- **Time > money**  
- **Coherence > control**  
- **Faith is structural, not ideological**  
- **Measurement must be benevolent, consensual, and interpretable**  
- **Exit, refusal, and tapering are signs of success**  

If a tool violates these principles, it does not belong here.

## System Layers

The platform is organised into four interacting layers:

### 1. Ecological & Policy Intelligence (KindEarth)
Tools that help read **pressure, drift, and constraint** in ecological
and social systems before collapse occurs.

### 2. Community & Life-Field Interfaces (KindPath)
Tools that support **people, families, and practitioners** to articulate
current reality, ideal reality, and movement over time.

### 3. Knowledge & Sovereignty Infrastructure
Digital libraries and data systems designed for **local ownership,
provenance, and consent**, not extraction.

### 4. Creative & Educational Interfaces
Outward-facing tools that reconnect people with land, sound,
creativity, and shared meaning.

## Tooling Overview

A canonical list of tools lives in:



/docs/tools/TOOLS_OVERVIEW.md


Each tool has:
- a clearly defined scope
- an explicit ethical posture
- documented non-goals
- boundaries around use

---

## Status

Current stage: **Prototype / Pilot Readiness**

This repository prioritises:
- clarity over completeness
- doctrine before automation
- manual validation before scaling

---

## Licence & Use

This work is shared openly for critique, collaboration,
and cautious real-world testing.

Use is subject to:
- ethical constraints
- sovereignty principles
- explicit refusal rights

See `/docs/governance/` for details.
