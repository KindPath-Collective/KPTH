# KindPath Digital Library Tool

## Purpose

The KindPath Digital Library Tool exists to support **local truth,
shared memory, and knowledge sovereignty** within communities.

It is designed to answer a simple question:

> “How do we know what we know — and who owns that knowing?”

---

## What this tool supports

- Community-owned digital libraries
- Clear authorship and provenance
- Versioning and changelogs
- Redaction and consent-aware access
- Cloud synchronisation with local ownership
- Signed exports for governance or audit

---

## What this tool explicitly does not do

- Rank or score knowledge
- Centralise authority
- Optimise narratives
- Extract data for third-party use
- Replace lived or custodial knowledge

---

## Ethical Posture

- Knowledge is **relational**, not neutral
- Refusal is a valid outcome
- Context travels with data
- Interpretation is local

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Community pilot documentation
- Local research libraries
- Practitioner reference stores
- Ecological and social evidence packs

---

## Success Signals

- Increased narrative clarity
- Reduced contradiction across interfaces
- Fewer disputes about “what was said or agreed”
- Knowledge remaining local after pilots conclude
