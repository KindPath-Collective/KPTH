# KindPath / KindEarth — Tool Overview

This document defines the canonical tool set within the KindPath /
KindEarth platform.

Tools are grouped by posture:
- **Inward-facing** (analysis, pilots, stewardship)
- **Outward-facing** (education, creativity, public engagement)

This separation is intentional and must be preserved.

- return time, not steal it
- increase agency, not dependency
- allow refusal without penalty
- degrade safely if misused

If a tool cannot meet these conditions, it is not built.
